## Actual API Scripts

This is a small repo of API scripts that do various things of questionable utility.

- [`tolls.js`](./tolls.js) - Uploads ExpressTolls transactions to a specified account
- [`supercharges.js`](./supercharges.js) - Uploads supercharging history to a specified account (as downloaded from the Tesla mobile app as CSV)
